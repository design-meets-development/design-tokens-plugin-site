            <h3 class="first">Can I include the notes in my exported document?</h3>

            <h3>What can I do if the plugin stops working after an Sketch update?</h3>
            <p>Don't panic. We usually release an update around the same date as Sketch does. You should receive an email with a download link shortly after that happens. If not, please make sure that you don't have any filter blocking our emails and that they're not sent directly to the spam folder or trash bin.</p>
            
            <h3>Why I didn't receive any link after my purchase?</h3>
            <p>Make sure that you are checking the email account that you entered when downloading the plugin and that there isn't any filter or proxy blocking our communications. If you don't get it please email us and we'll solve the issue for you.</p>
